# Requirements

## 1. Draw a 3D Scene

### Objects:
- **3D Building**: 
  - At least 2 floors
  - A roof
  - One door
  - Four windows
- **3D Bicycle**

## 2. Apply Color Models

### Color Specifications:
- **Building**: Apply suitable colors to each object in the building.
- **Background**: Change the background to green.
- **Bicycle**: Apply black color to the 3D Bicycle.

## 3. Apply Transformations on the Building

- Use key `c` to close the door with a suitable angle.
- Use key `O` to open the windows with a suitable angle.
- Use key `C` to close the windows with a suitable angle.

## 4. Apply Transformations on the Bicycle

### Transformations:
- Use key `f` to move the bicycle forward in the X-axis direction.
- Use key `b` to move the bicycle backward in the X-axis direction.
- Use key `r` to rotate the right wheel with a suitable angle.
- Use key `l` to rotate the left wheel with a suitable angle.

## 5. Move the Bicycle in a Circular Street

### Animations:
- Use the mouse left button to enable animation so that the bicycle starts rotating around the building.
- Use the mouse right button to disable animation.

## 6. [Bounce] Control Camera Coordinates

### Camera Controls:
- Control camera coordinates to see the 3D scene from different directions.
- Use key `Arrow Left` to move the camera left.
- Use key `Arrow Right` to move the camera right.
- Use key `Arrow Up` to move the camera upword.
- Use key `Arrow Down` to move the camera downword.
- Use key `w` to increase the field of view.
- Use key `s` to decrease the field of view.
